                            <p>A brokerage firm acts as an intermediary that brings together buyers and sellers to execute transactions for shares, bonds, options, and other financial instruments. It receives a commission or fee for the job it does. Depending on the level of service it provides and if there is direct contact with human beings rather than computer algorithms, the distinction can be made between full-service (traditional) and discount (online) brokerage.</p>

                            <p>Full-service brokers offer a range of products and services, including market research and personal financial advisors to provide help and guidance to each client. With online brokers, investors themselves input their buy and sell orders electronically into the broker's automated trading platform.</p>
